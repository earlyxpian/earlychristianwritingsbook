# Chapter 1: *The Two Ways*

## Introduction

## Translation

The Lord’s Teaching to the Heathen by the Twelve Apostles:

**1**.1. There are two ways, one of life and one of death; and between the two ways there is a great difference.

2\. Now, this is the way of life: “First, you must love God who made you, and second, your neighbor as yourself.” And whatever you want people to refrain from doing to you, you must not do to them.

3\. What these maxims teach is this: “Bless those who curse you,” and “pray for your enemies.” Moreover, fast “for those who persecute you.” For “what credit is it to you if you love those who love you? Is that not the way the heathen act?” But “you must love those who hate you,” and then you will make no enemies. 4. “Abstain from carnal passions.” If someone strikes you “on the right cheek, turn to him the other too, and you will be perfect.” If someone “forces you to go one mile with him, go along with him for two”; if someone robs you “of your overcoat, give him your suit as well.” If someone deprives you of “your property, do not ask for it back.” (You could not get it back anyway!) 5. “Give to everybody who begs from you, and ask for no return.” For the Father wants his own gifts to be universally shared. Happy is the man who gives as the commandment bids him, for he is guiltless! But alas for the man who receives! If he receives because he is in need, he will be guiltless. But if he is not in need he will have to stand trial why he received and for what purpose. He will be thrown into prison and have his action investigated; and “he will not get out until he has paid back the last cent.” 6. Indeed, there is a further saying that relates to this: “Let your donation sweat in your hands until you know to whom to give it.”

**2**.1. The second commandment of the Teaching: 2. “Do not murder; do not commit adultery”; do not corrupt boys; do not fornicate; “do not steal”; do not practice magic; do not go in for sorcery; do not murder a child by abortion or kill a new-born infant. “Do not covet your neighbor’s property; 3. do not commit perjury; do not bear false witness”; do not slander; do not bear grudges. 4. Do not be double-minded or double-tongued, for a double tongue is “a deadly snare.” 5. Your words shall not be dishonest or hollow, but substantiated by action. 6. Do not be greedy or extortionate or hypocritical or malicious or arrogant. Do not plot against your neighbor. 7. Do not hate anybody; but reprove some, pray for others, and still others love more than your own life.

**3**.1. My child, flee from all wickedness and from everything of that sort. 2. Do not be irritable, for anger leads to murder. Do not be jealous or contentious or impetuous, for all this breeds murder.

3\. My child, do not be lustful, for lust leads to fornication. Do not use foul language or leer, for all this breeds adultery.

4\. My child, do not be a diviner, for that leads to idolatry. Do not be an enchanter or an astrologer or a magician. Moreover, have no wish to observe or heed such practices, for all this breeds idolatry.

5\. My child, do not be a liar, for lying leads to theft. Do not be avaricious or vain, for all this breeds thievery.

6\. My child, do not be a grumbler, for grumbling leads to blasphemy. Do not be stubborn or evil-minded, for all this breeds blasphemy.

7\. But be humble since “the humble will inherit the earth.” 8. Be patient, merciful, harmless, quiet, and good; and always “have respect for the teaching” you have been given. Do not put on airs or give yourself up to presumptuousness. Do not associate with the high and mighty; but be with the upright and humble. Accept whatever happens to you as good, in the realization that nothing occurs apart from God.

**4**.1. My child, day and night “you should remember him who preaches God’s word to you,” and honor him as you would the Lord. For where the Lord’s nature is discussed, there the Lord is. 2. Every day you should seek the company of saints to enjoy their refreshing conversation. 3. You must not start a schism, but reconcile those at strife. “Your judgments must be fair.” You must not play favorites when reproving transgressions. 4. You must not be of two minds about your decision.

5\. Do not be one who holds his hand out to take, but shuts it when it comes to giving. 6. If your labor has brought you earnings, pay a ransom for your sins. 7. Do not hesitate to give and do not give with a bad grace; for you will discover who He is that pays you back a reward with a good grace. 8. Do not turn your back on the needy, but share everything with your brother and call nothing your own. For if you have what is eternal in common, how much more should you have what is transient!

9\. Do not neglect your responsibility to your son or your daughter, but from their youth you shall teach them to revere God. 10. Do not be harsh in giving orders to your slaves and slave girls. They hope in the same God as you, and the result may be that they cease to revere the God over you both. For when he comes to call us, he will not respect our station, but will call those whom the Spirit has made ready. 11. You slaves, for your part, must obey your masters with reverence and fear, as if they represented God.

12\. You must hate all hypocrisy and everything which fails to please the Lord. 13. You must not forsake “the Lord’s commandments,” but “observe” the ones you have been given, “neither adding nor subtracting anything.” 14. At the church meeting you must confess your sins, and not approach prayer with a bad conscience. That is the way of life.

**5**.1. But the way of death is this: First of all, it is wicked and thoroughly blasphemous: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, sorceries, robberies, false witness, hypocrisies, duplicity, deceit, arrogance, malice, stubbornness, greediness, filthy talk, jealousy, audacity, haughtiness, boastfulness.

2\. Those who persecute good people, who hate truth, who love lies, who are ignorant of the reward of uprightness, who do not “abide by goodness” or justice, and are on the alert not for goodness but for evil: gentleness and patience are remote from them. “They love vanity,” “look for profit,” have no pity for the poor, do not exert themselves for the oppressed, ignore their Maker, “murder children,” corrupt God’s image, turn their backs on the needy, oppress the afflicted, defend the rich, unjustly condemn the poor, and are thoroughly wicked. My children, may you be saved from all this!
